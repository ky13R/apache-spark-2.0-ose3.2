## The following uses a 750G NFS volume mounted to the spark master pod (/mnt) that has been populated with Wikidata (available through AWS if wanting to use the same dataset as the following example)

# On the spark master pod
spark-shell

# set variables (example)
sc.setLogLevel("INFO")
val pagecounts = sc.textFile("/mnt/wikistats/pagecounts")

# process 100 records
pagecounts.take(100)

# process everything in a directory
pagecounts.count
